# Google Trends Data and Visualisation

## Requirements  

Open Google Colab Notebook in through your Google Drive. You can find the Python Notebook under New → More → Google Colaboratory     

If you cannot access the Google Colab Notebooks or would like to run everything locally on your computer, then I recommend installing Anaconda and using the bundled Jupyter Notebook instead. Either way works. Google Colab is essentially just an online version of Jupyter.

## How does it work?

Upload the Bitcoin Search Trend.csv, Daily Bitcoin Price.csv, TESLA Search Trend vs Price.csv, UE Benefits Search vs UE Rate 2004-19.csv, and UE Benefits Search vs UE Rate 2004-20.csv files into google colab project and exectute the command Run all.
